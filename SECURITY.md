# Security Policy

## ðŸ”’ Security Overview

Live JS takes security seriously. This document outlines our security measures and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures

### Code Execution Security
- **JavaScript execution sandboxing** - Code runs in isolated environment
- **Timeout protection** - Prevents infinite loops and long-running processes
- **Memory and CPU limits** - Resource usage is controlled and limited
- **Input/output sanitization** - All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Process isolation** - Each execution runs in a separate process

### Web Application Security
- **CORS** properly configured to prevent unauthorized access
- **Content Security Policy** implemented
- **XSS protection** through input sanitization
- **CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
- **Secure headers** implemented (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Data Protection
- **No persistent storage** of user code on servers
- **Local storage only** for user preferences
- **No sensitive data collection**
- **Encrypted connections** (HTTPS/WSS)

## Limitations and Restrictions

### Execution Environment
- System module imports are restricted
- Limited file system access
- Network access is controlled
- Execution in isolated environment
- Resource usage monitoring

### Known Limitations
- Code execution timeout: 30 seconds maximum
- Memory limit: 128MB per execution
- No access to system files or directories
- Limited to standard JavaScript APIs
